<h1>The best movies according to Arpita </h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies all the time</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Cocktail</h3>
<p>It begins wonderfully & offers some hilarious moments, but in the latter hour, the proceedings not only become serious but also very dry. Nonetheless, a decent effort! 'Cocktail' is about 3 friends, of whom each, falls in love with one another.
</p>
<h3>Piku</h3>
<p>I have come across many movies that explore a father-daughter relationship, but none has been so touching, beautiful and emotional as Piku. You never need an occasion to watch it again. In fact, you might as well get a tiny trip to Kolkata as you lounge on your sofa in the middle of lockdown.</p>
<h3>3 idiots</h3>
<p>3 Idiots is not just a film about friendship and love; it delves deeper into the societal pressure faced by students in India. It criticizes the rote-learning system, which stifles creativity and encourages competition over understanding. Rancho, the heart of the movie, symbolizes rebellion against this system.</p>
